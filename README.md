# guirepo
This is a repo to test the basic gui capabilities of the PyQT5 Pythong Gui Framework
The idea is to create a simple gui that does the following:
1: allows you to select a file from a directory 
2: read data from this file
3: generate a new file based on the data in the input file 
2: Save the generated file from step 3 to a directory with the desired name
